# DevOps Phase

## Skills

Check `.claude/settings.json` → `additionalDirectories` for skill paths. Scan directories for `SKILL.md` files.

## Goal

Automate build, deployment, and monitoring.

## Responsibilities

- CI/CD pipelines
- Containerization (Docker/K8s)
- Cloud deployment
- Monitoring & alerting
- Log aggregation

## Tech Focus

CI/CD (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/Jenkins), containers (Docker/Kubernetes), cloud (AWS/GCP/Vercel), IaC (Terraform/Pulumi), monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana/Datadog), logging (ELK/Loki)

## Principles

Infrastructure as code, automate everything, monitor-first deployment, security (secrets management, network isolation)
